Table Schema provides a way to declare types, formats, and constraints for fields in a tabular data set. The data set can be in any format, from a simple text file to a database, and the Table Schema descriptor can be represented as JSON or any other simple data format that a programming language supports.
 
Working with data invariably means moving data between systems and serialization formats. The lifecycle of a dataset may mean it moves from Excel, to CSV, to a database, to a search index, to a visualization framework, and so on.
 
Table Schema provides a way to reliably declare the shape of the data across such a variety of storage and display platforms in a completely platform-agnostic way. Data described by Table Schema can be validated for consistency and quality.
 
Table Schema is part of [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), a project funded and maintained by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org) and [Datopian](https://datopian.com).

## Where it is used
 
Table Schema is a useful solution at various stages of data work. Ensuring your data is well-formed towards a set of expectations is critical to doing meaningful work with data, and is exactly the role Table Schema can play.

In addition to the core software we develop for Frictionless Data, Table Schema has seen adoption among widely used tools for working with data such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.io.json.build_table_schema.html).
 
## A simple example
 
```
{
  "name": "my-table-schema",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "age",
      "type": "integer",
    },
    {
      "name": "vocation",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```
