# Frictionless Data

<big><strong>Get basic understanding of Frictionless in "5 minutes".</strong></big>

Frictionless Data is a progressive open-source framework for building data infrastructure -- data management, data integration, data flows, etc. It includes various data standards and provide software to work with data.

:::tip
This introduction assumes some basic knowledge about data. If you are new to working with data it may be  best idea to get some of those basics and then come back! A good starting point would be the first module, "What is Data?", at [School of Data](https://schoolofdata.org/).

## What is Frictionless

We made a short video to introduce the project. You can watch it first or read below instead.

The core of the framework is a suite of ultra-simple patterns to describe and organize data. This allows the data to flow fluidly between tools and across teams. The patterns have been refined to zen-like simplicity, and they can be picked up in minutes and immediately integrated with other libraries or existing projects.

At the same time, Frictionless Data is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated data workflows when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries. This is possible because the framework follows an "atomic" approach where specs and tools are broken down into small components that can be used on their own but also composed together to make larger ones. This allows you to take a minimalistic approach for simple solutions and then combine elements components for more complex solutions.

Unlike some other frameworks, Frictionless is designed from the ground up to be both incrementally adoptable and "progressive". Its purpose is to work with, build on, and enhance your existing data and tooling (rather than replacing it). It is also extremely lightweight!

## How to use Frictionless

Frictionless Data consists of two main parts, software and standards.

Usually, new users start from trying out the [Software](/software) which give an ability to work with Frictionless using visual interfaces or programming languages. For example, there are two high-level data frameworks (for Python and JavaScript) and low-level libraries for 10 platforms. On other hand, you might be interested in using our data services for discovering, storing or validating data. At the moment, we work hard on implementing Frictionless Application and Frictionless Repository which also have visual interfaces. To get started, choose the software you're interested in and follow its link to get to corresponding documentation.

The [Standards](/standards) is also a vital part of the project. It helps to describe your data, for example, a collection of files as a data package or a table as a table schema. As a new user you might not need to dive to deep into the specifications as our software incapsulate its concepts. On the other hand, once you feel comfortable with Frictionless Software you might start reading Frictionless Standards to get better understanding of the things happening under the hood or to start creating your metadata descriptors more profitiantly.

## Where to apply Frictionless

The Frictionless Data project is very diverse in terms of possible audience.

![Audience](/img/introduction/audience.png)

During our project development we had various collaborations with institutions and indivisuals. We keep track on our [Pilots](/tag/pilot) and [Case Studies](/tag/case-studies) and our community and core members are open to share their experience using our standards and software. Generally speaking, you can apply Frictionless almost in every field in which you need to have a deal with data. It might be a simple tables validation or complex data pipelines.

## Ready for more? Keep Going!

It was a short introduction of the Frictionless Data. As the next steps, we reccommend you to start using one of our [Software](/software) projects, get known our [Standards](/standards) or read about other user experience in [Pilots](/tag/pilot) and [Case Studies](/tag/case-studies) sections.
