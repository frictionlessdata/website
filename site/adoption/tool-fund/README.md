# Tool Fund

## Introduction

The Frictionless Data Tool Fund, overseen by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org/) and supported by the Sloan Foundation, is providing mini-grants of $5,000 to support individuals or organisations in developing an open tool for reproducible science or research built using the Frictionless Data specifications and software. For this year, we will prioritize tools focusing on the following fields/broad domains of science: biology, genetics, neuroscience, ecology, geology, and bioinformatics. We welcomed submissions of interest from 1 March 2020 until 17th May 2020. Projects started mid-June and to will be completed by the end of the year.

Applicants from communities that are under-represented in science and technology, people of colour, women, people with disabilities, and LGBTI+ individuals are encouraged to apply.

## Background

The Tool Fund is part of the <a href="http://frictionlessdata.io/reproducible-research/" target="_blank">Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research</a> project at <a href="https://okfn.org" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>. This project, funded by the Sloan Foundation, applies our work in Frictionless Data to data-driven research disciplines, in order to facilitate data workflows in research contexts. At its core, Frictionless Data is a set of <a href="http://frictionlessdata.io/specs/" target="_blank">specifications</a> for data and metadata interoperability, accompanied by a collection of <a href="http://frictionlessdata.io/software/" target="_blank">software libraries</a> that implement these specifications, and a range of best practices for data management. The core specification, the <a href="http://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package/" target="_blank">Data Package</a>, is a simple and practical “container” for data and metadata. For examples of successful projects, read about the 2019 Tool Fund Grantees [here](https://blog.okfn.org/2019/07/04/meet-our-2019-frictionless-data-tool-fund-grantees/).
