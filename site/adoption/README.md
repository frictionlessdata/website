## Grant-funded work

### Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research

From September 2018 til December 2021, the Frictionless Data team focused on enhanced dissemination and training activities, and further iterations on our software and specifications via a range of collaborations with research partners. We aimed to use Frictionless tooling to resolve research data workflow issues, create a new wave of open science advocates, and teach about FAIR data management. This pivotal work was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and overseen by the Frictionless team at the Open Knowledge Foundation. You can read more details about this grant [here](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/07/12/sloan-foundation-funds-frictionless-data-for-reproducible-research/).

#### Pilot Collaborations

Pilots are intensive, hands-on collaborations with researcher teams to resolve their research data management workflow issues with Frictionless Data software and specs. You can read about the Pilot projects on our [blog](/tag/pilot/).

#### Tool Fund

The Tool Fund is a $5000 grant to develop an open tool for reproducible science or research built using the Frictionless Data codebase. Learn more by reading [Tool Fund Blogs](/tag/tool-fund/) or by visiting the [Tool Fund site](https://toolfund.frictionlessdata.io/).

#### Fellows Programme

The <a href="https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/">Fellows Programme</a> is training early career researchers to become champions of the Frictionless Data tools and approaches in their field. Read more about the 2019-2020 Fellows <a href="https://blog.okfn.org/2019/08/29/a-warm-welcome-to-our-frictionless-data-for-reproducible-research-fellows/">here</a>.

### Data Institutions - Website Update

In 2021, we partnered with the Open Data Institute (ODI) to improve our existing documentation and add new features on Frictionless Data to create a better user experience for all. Working with a series of feedback sessions from our community members, we created our new [documentation portal](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io/) for the Frictionless Framework and several new tutorials. Read more about this grant [here](https://blog.okfn.org/2021/04/14/unveiling-the-new-frictionless-data-documentation-portal/).

### Frictionless Field Guide

In 2017, OKF received funding from the Open Data Institute to create a Frictionless Data Field Guide. This guide provided step-by-step instructions for improving data publishing workflows. The field guide introduced new ways of working informed by the Frictionless Data suite of software that data publishers can use independently, or adapt into existing personal and organisational workflows. You can read more details about this work [here](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/03/27/improving-your-data-publishing-workflow-with-the-frictionless-data-field-guide/).

### Data Package Integrations

In 2016, Google funded OKF to work on tool integration for Data Packages as part of our broader work on Frictionless Data to support the open data community. You can read more about this work [here](https://blog.okfn.org/2016/02/01/google-funds-frictionless-data-initiative-at-open-knowledge/).

### Data Packages Development

In 2016, OKF received funding from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to work on a broad range of activities to enable better research and more effective civic tech through Frictionless Data. The funding targeted standards work, tooling, and infrastructure around “data packages” as well as piloting and outreach activities to support researchers and civic technologists in addressing real problems encountered when working with data.
