# Contribute
 
We welcome contributions -- and you don't have to be a software developer to get involved. The first step to become a Frictionless Data contributor is to become a Frictionless Data user. You may use it as an "end-user," or as a developer of a library that relies on Data Packages, for instance.
 
## Issues

Report issues with projects in their own issue tracker, on GitHub. Doubts on where exactly? Drop us a line in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat). You may also decide to engage in existing issues and help other users. What if the issue is not a bug but a question? Please head to the [forum](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/forum/issues). It is an excellent place to give us thorough feedback about your experience as a whole. In the same way, you may participate in existing discussions and make your voice heard.
 
## Documentation 

Talking about getting yourself heard, we welcome contributions seeking to advocate and educate people in the data space. Given that we work on specifications and tools for a Frictionless Data experience, you may decide that [writing tutorials](/contribute/), [improving documentation](/contribute/), or even speaking at conferences is your favorite way of contributing. You don't have to ask permission to talk about Frictionless Data, but we love hearing when people tell us beforehand because we can try to help on sharing the news with a wider audience.
 
## Coding

Look for issues with "help wanted" or "first-time contributor."
